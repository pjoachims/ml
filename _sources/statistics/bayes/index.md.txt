```{admonition} Bayes' Theorem
---
---
Bayes' Theorem relates the probability that an event $A$ occurs to prior knowledge (e.g., event $B$ occurred).

$$
\underbrace{p(A | B)}_{\text{posterior}}
	=
	\frac
	{
		\overbrace{p\left(B, A\right)}^{\text{likelihood}}
        \text{ }
		\overbrace{p(A)}^{\text{prior}}
	}
	{
		\underbrace{P(B)}_{\text{evidence}}
	}
$$
